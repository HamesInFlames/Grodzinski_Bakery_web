        <h1>About Grodzinski Bakery</h1>
        <p className="section__text">
          Grodzinski has been baking for families for generations, bringing
          together European recipes, kosher tradition, and the rhythm of
          Toronto life. What began as a neighbourhood bakery has grown into a
          destination for challah, cakes, breads, and catering.
        </p>
        <p className="section__text">
          We prepare vegetarian, dairy, and meat-friendly options, as well as
          vegan choices, using a wide variety of breads, buns, and wraps. Our
          focus is on fresh, natural ingredients and recipes that feel
          handmade, not factory-made.
        </p>
        <p className="section__text">
          Our Toronto bakery operates as a peanut- and tree-nut-free facility,
          so families with nut allergies can shop with greater peace of mind.
